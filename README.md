### Hi there 👋

I'm a student at Caltech studying Computer Science and Data Science who loves to learn.

Currently I'm,

🤖 collaborating in the [Caltech Data Science Organization](http://datascience.caltech.edu/)
🌱 making web applications in my free time
🎮 practicing Unity and making games
🏃🏻 competing in cross country and track

This summer, I interned at 🔭 [NASA JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) 🔭 implementing an iterative modeling system for Jupiter's atmosphere. We discovered temporal and longitudinal differences in multiple atmospheric components!

🎓 From my experiences, I've learned Python, Java, HTML/CSS, C, JavaScript, SQL, Swift along with tools like React, Flask, and Unity.

📥 You can reach me through email at [rchan@caltech.edu], or through my LinkedIn account at [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ry-chan/].
